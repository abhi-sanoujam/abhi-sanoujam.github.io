Here's a nice post I came up with when I was looking on how to set up ssh server up and running on my win box with 
Cygwin.

Setting up ssh server on cygwin</a>


After setting up ssh server and starting it, use putty to connect to ur own localhost. It feels much better using 
putty than cmd.exe to use the shell. cmd sux !!

Enjoy
