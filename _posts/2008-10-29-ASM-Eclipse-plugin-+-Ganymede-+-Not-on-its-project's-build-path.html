ASM plugin for eclipse found <a href="http://asm.objectweb.org/eclipse/index.html">here</a> works neat upto Eclipse 3.3<br />If you have updated to Eclipse Ganymede, you will see that it no longer works.<br />It complains something like:<br /><code><br />Error (Bytecode Outline) src/Foo.java [in BarProject] is not on its project's build path.<br /></code><br /><br />Where Foo.java is the java class for which you want to view the bytecode and MyProject is the eclipse project in which it is present.<br /><br />After a little bit of googling found out that a new version of the plugin is available for Eclipse Ganymede.Â <div>You can get the new version at <a href="http://andrei.gmxhome.de/bytecode/index.html">http://andrei.gmxhome.de/bytecode/index.html</a>.<br />Use <a href="http://andrei.gmxhome.de/eclipse/">http://andrei.gmxhome.de/eclipse/</a> as the update URL with the update manager and install the new version.<br /><br />Works cool now :)</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/abhisanoujam-blogspot/~4/40PQUXJvhEk" height="1" width="1"/>
