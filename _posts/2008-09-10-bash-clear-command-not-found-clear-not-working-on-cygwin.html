Ok so you installed Cygwin and try out your first commands.... u cluttered ur screen and its time for doing a "clear".
<br/>
<br/>Ooops... its giving you a "bash: clear: command not found". You just can't clear the dumb screen. I know thats
frustrating....
<br/>
<br/>So which dumb package did you miss when installing cygwin --- its the ncurses package.
Open cygwin setup again and choose ncurses library from the "Lib" package. Once you've installed that, clear will start working.

<br/><br/>If you are lazy enough and don't want to download stuff, just use "Ctrl+L" to clear your screen.<br/><br/>
<br/>Keep clearing...
