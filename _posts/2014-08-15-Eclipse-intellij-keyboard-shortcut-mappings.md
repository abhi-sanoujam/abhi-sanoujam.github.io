Alright! So you've been using [eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) and know its keyboard shortcut-fu quite well. 
And you just moved to using [IntelliJ](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - and your eclipse shortcut-fu doesn't apply 
anymore. How you wish there was a quick cheat sheet that translates your eclipse shortcuts to its equivalent IntelliJ
 mappings - i know, i had the same wish :)

So, here's a quick mapping between eclipse and IntelliJ keyboard shortcuts for most commonly used ones - mostly for 
java developers on mac. Hope this helps...

Description | Eclipse |    Intellij

Refactor -> Rename          |cmd-shift-R  |       shift+F6     
Maximize/Minimize           |cmd+M         |      cmd+shift+F12      
Quick Javadoc                |    hover                    |ctrl+J     
Next Search Match          |cmd-K               |ctrl-L          
Generate                    |     cmd+shift+S |         ctrl+N     
Reformat Code              | cmd+shift+F        |  alt+cmd+L     
Organize Imports          |cmd+shift+O|          alt+cmd+O     
Refresh/Synchronize         | cmd+R |              alt+cmd+Y     
Delete line                    |cmd+D |              cmd+Y     
Move line                    |alt+up/down |    alt+shift+up/down     
Next error                    |cmd+.        |  F2     
Surround with               |cmd+shift+S |         cmd+alt+T     
Show parameters          |ctrl+space?      |    cmd+P     
Highlight usage of var/selected word     |cmd+K?? |    shift+cmd+F7   
Scroll to top/bottom                    |fn+up/down |    fn+cmd+up/down
Show class hierarchy     |F4     |ctrl+H

Also, in IntelliJ you can use something called "CamelHumps words" - which is when navigating between words using 
alt+L or alt+R, cursor will move following camelCasing instead of whole words. I find that quite useful.
You can enable that in IntelliJ by going to Settings -> Editor -> Smart Keys and enable "Use CamelHumps words"

Enjoy...
