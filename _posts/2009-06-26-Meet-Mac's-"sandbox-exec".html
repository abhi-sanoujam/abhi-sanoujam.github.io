I was working on something to block outgoing connections for one particular app *only*. And I use a mac, leopard... the first place I went to look was System Preferences -> Security -> Firewall pane. And I was disappointed to find no "Block Outgoing Connections"<br />It can only block incoming connections. Anyway...<br /><br />Then I met sandbox-exec :) It runs apps in a sandbox, which you can define to restrict access to different resources, network, file-systems etc Here's a simple sandbox file which denies network access...<br /><br /><pre name="code" class="bash:collapse"><br /><br />(version 1)<br />(allow default)<br />(deny network*)<br /><br /></pre><br /><br />Running sandbox-exec with the above file will deny all network access to your app, both outgoing and incoming. Here's a screenshot example showing running bash with and without it:<br /><br /><pre class="console"><br /><br />$ ping -t3 google.com<br />PING google.com (74.125.67.100): 56 data bytes<br />64 bytes from 74.125.67.100: icmp_seq=0 ttl=49 time=368.312 ms<br />64 bytes from 74.125.67.100: icmp_seq=1 ttl=49 time=318.240 ms<br />64 bytes from 74.125.67.100: icmp_seq=2 ttl=49 time=319.793 ms<br /><br />--- google.com ping statistics ---<br />3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0% packet loss<br />round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 318.240/335.448/368.312/23.247 ms<br />$ <br />$<br />$ cat block-network.sb <br />(version 1)<br />(allow default)<br />(deny network*)<br />$ <br />$ sandbox-exec -f block-network.sb /bin/bash <br />$ ping -t3 google.com<br />bash: /sbin/ping: Operation not permitted<br />$ ping -t3 yahoo.com<br />bash: /sbin/ping: Operation not permitted<br />$ ping -t3 apple.com<br />bash: /sbin/ping: Operation not permitted<br />$ exit<br />exit<br />$ ping -t3 google.com<br />PING google.com (74.125.67.100): 56 data bytes<br />64 bytes from 74.125.67.100: icmp_seq=0 ttl=49 time=321.997 ms<br />64 bytes from 74.125.67.100: icmp_seq=1 ttl=49 time=321.350 ms<br />64 bytes from 74.125.67.100: icmp_seq=2 ttl=49 time=321.676 ms<br /><br />--- google.com ping statistics ---<br />3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0% packet loss<br />round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 321.350/321.674/321.997/0.264 ms<br />$<br /><br /></pre><br /><br /><br />If you want to write more sophisticated sandbox files, you should probably check out the files present in <tt>/usr/share/sandbox/</tt><br /><br /><br />Enjoy...<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/abhisanoujam-blogspot/~4/c7mAmEQ6Ky0" height="1" width="1"/>
